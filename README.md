My thesis project was to create a prototype for an iOS mobile application that could improve nightlife experiences for students of legal age across the country. No such iOS application with my features exists for the students, so I wanted to create an in-depth prototype application that could be brought to populated campuses and cities. To make the iOS application, I used a program called Xcode, which is used primarily for building iOS applications. It has many built-in features that smoothed the process for developers who are new to iOS and Mac such as myself. The programming language that I used in Xcode was Swift/SwiftUI. My application, BarCheck, pulls data from both Apple Maps and Google Maps APIs. This data, along with user-submitted reviews, help provide reviews, multifaceted ratings, and precise locations for specific bars/clubs for which users can explore. Users can use this information to expand their nightlife experience, meet new people, and educate others on their findings. In the end, I succeeded in making the prototype application that functioned exactly how I wanted it to function. Additionally, I would like to continue my work on the application to create more features and further improve the functionality for the users. ![image](https://github.com/ipetrell/BarCheck/assets/89494790/dc25b04b-16da-4a21-9e68-8db88da7bb15)
